# Interlinkingwithkmeanstreamlit
This repo is a self contained web app for categorising urls to look for inlinking opportunities. 

Simply upload an internal_html file from screamingfrog then download the .xlsx file containing your categorised URLs.

To run this app, clone onto your IDE (I use pycharm) and run the following command in the terminal: streamlit run main.py
